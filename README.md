# EV Bike Light Control System

## Project Goal
This project aims to build a practical lighting control system for an electric bike.

The system will include:
- Startup ambient lighting animation
- Speed-based color and breathing effects
- Rear approaching vehicle warning lights

This project is designed for learning and real-world implementation.

## Development Plan
- Phase 1: Basic LED control and startup animation
- Phase 2: Speed-based color and breathing control
- Phase 3: Rear distance warning lighting
- Phase 4: Voice and app control (future)

## Tech Stack
- Embedded C
- MCU-based control
- Addressable RGB LEDs
